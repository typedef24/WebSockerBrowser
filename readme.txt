-> To compile the code, use the command:
   gcc webSocker.c -o webSocker  `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0 webkit-1.0`
-> To run/execute the program, run the command:
   ./webSocker
   If you have the browser package well copied into your system and with the right execution 	permisions, you can skip the compilation phase and then simply run the program by simply  	double clicking on the webSocker icon in the package folder.
